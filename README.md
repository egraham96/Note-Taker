# Homework Assignment 11-Note Taker

## Description:
This week's homework required us to create an application that would allow users to create and save notes, such as to-do list items. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. The front end of the application was created for us and utilizes HTML, CSS and Javascript. The entire application is deployed and available for use on Heroku via the following link: 

## Installation Instructions:
Ideally, you would use this application by visting the deployed application link on Heroku. If you would like to use this application without Heroku, use the following steps:

First, clone this repository. Navigate to the directory containing repository in your terminal. Navigate to the Develop folder. In your terminal, enter "npm install" to install all of the application's dependencies. If "npm install" does not work on its own, try to first enter "npm install express" followed by "npm install path" followed by "npm install file-system". Then, in your terminal, type in "node server.js." Navigate to the link provided: http://localhost:${PORT}.
